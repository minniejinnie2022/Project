		<h5>What can fire do to us? Heat is more threatening than flames. Room temperatures in a fire can be 100 degrees at floor level and rise to 600 degrees at eye level. Inhaling this super-hot air will scorch your lungs and melt clothes to your skin. Most people who die in fires die from the toxic gases, thick smoke and lack of oxygen. In a fire, breathing even small amounts of these toxic elements can be disorienting, causing some people to pass out. Remember smoke detectors save lives. The time to react to a fire/smoke alarm is when it first goes off.</h5>

        	<td>Inspect your heating sources</td>
        	<td>House fires may very well be triggered if your home heating sources are not working properly. Be sure to always clean out your air conditioning filters, keep your heaters away from anything that is flammable, and have these things checked out by a professional once a year.</td>

        	<td>Store any flammable products correctly</td>

        	<td>Maintain your wires</td>
        	<td>Before you plug something into a socket, try to be courteous in ensuring that the wire hasnâ€™t been torn or chewed up (in case you have any pets running around). Damaged wires can be a detrimental fire hazard and need replacing as soon as possible. Also, remember that wires do get hot when in use, so be sure to check your wire placement and avoiding passing them under a carpet or anywhere that could potentially catch fire.</td>

        	<td>We get it, itâ€™s nice having some candles lit up around the house to create a romantic atmosphere, or perhaps even getting the fireplace going to make your home feel even toastier on a cold winter evening. We arenâ€™t going to tell you to avoid candles and fireplaces altogether, however we do encourage you to practice with caution. If you feel yourself dosing off, turn off all your candles beforehand, and if you have pets, keep these open flames out of their reach as much as possible.</td>

        <tr>
        	<td>Keep a fire extinguisher or blanket around at all times</td>
        	<td>Fire extinguishers and blankets will be your best defence in the event of a fire breaking out. Every family member should know how to use a fire extinguisher, so in case something in your home does catch fire, it can be put out as fast as possible. Fire blankets are also very useful for putting out small fires before they become something larger and fiercer.</td>
